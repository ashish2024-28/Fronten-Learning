git is a version control system

github=>




pwd => present working drive
ls => list of file
ls -a => hidden file or (in Powersell comand => ls -Force)
ls -s
for clear on command => clear (clear all) 

<!-- cd change directory -->
cd.. => for back folder 
cd fileName (means change directory)
cd \All_Projects\ (tab for autocomplit)

<!-- local and remote -->
local => (system/pc) and remote => (github)

config globaly
configuring git =>   git config --global user.name "ashish2024-28"
                     git config --global user.email "ashish222244q@gmail.com"
check all(setup details)            git config --list

remote => (github)

git ki  basic command
1. clone : cloning a repository on our local m/c (copy remote to local)
    <!-- git clone projectlink -->
    ex=> git clone https://github.com/ashish2024-28/All_Projects.git

   4 types of status
   1.Untracked => new files that git does't yet track 
   2.modified => changed
   3.Unmodified => unchange 
   4.staged => file is ready to be committed

   <!-- ststus, add and commit then push -->
   (for check status)
   git status 

   <!-- add files -->
   git add fileName  (or)
   git add . =>(for all)

   <!-- commit files => leagal record ya meaning full message -->
   git commit -m "msg"
   git commit -m "new index.html"

   <!-- push => upload local repo to remot repo  -->
   (copy local to  remote )
   git push origin main
   <!-- origin => name of repo(by default) and mian is branch -->


2.init : use to creat a new git repo 

   <!-- git remote add -->
   git remote add origin link => link of new repository(repo)

   <!-- git remot -v (to verify remote) -->
    git remote -v 

   <!-- git branch  (to check current branch) -->
    git branch

   <!-- git branch -M newName (to rename) -->

   <!-- git push origin main -->
   <!-- git push -u origin main => to set upstream means origin me pay se all operation-->

   <!-- ststus, add and commit then push -->



<!-- branching => multiple branch -->
   <!-- git branch -->
      git branch    (check kon se branch pay hai)
      * main (by default)
   
   <!-- git branch -M newName (to rename) -->
      git branch -M newName

   <!-- to navigate -->
      git checkout branchName

   <!--  git checkout -b newBranchName -->
      git checkout -b feature (creat new branch)

   
   <!-- git branch -d deleteBranchName -->
      git branch -d feature2


   <!-- Switched to a new branch 'feature' -->
      for switch (change branch)  
      git checkout feature
      git checkout branchName

   
<!-- merging code -->
merging branch :- 
   <!-- way 1 -->
      ( direct marge from github) 
      crear a PR => it lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on fithub
   <!-- way 2 -->
      1. git diff (branchName)
      2. git merge branchName


<!-- pull (copy local to  remote  for both branch) first marge so use pull -->
      git pull origin main


<!-- Merge Conflicts -->

main branch me any other branch ka (files) add



github say delete

git branch orifin -delete branchName

for Undo (reset)
git log => (se #code(jo ve commit kiya ho))
git reset (fileName,#code)



<!-- exesting repo add -->
